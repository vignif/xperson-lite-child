# Custome Theme for wordpress

This repo helps me in keeping track of the upgrades and desired design choice for my personal website.
Feel free to fork it and use it for your personal space also.

The tool [wp-pusher](https://wppusher.com/) helps me with the automatic deploy on my production-server (my website) of the updated and locally tested new theme.

Here you can find the implementation:
